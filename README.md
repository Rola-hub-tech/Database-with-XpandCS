ðŸŽ‰ Wrapping Up a Week of Learning: Databases! ðŸ“š

The second week of my training with XpandCS marked an exciting milestone in my training journey as I completed an in-depth focus on databases. From designing efficient schemas to writing SQL queries and exploring databases.

ðŸ’¡ Here are some highlights of what I learned:

Database design principles

Writing SQL queries

Hands-on practice with relational databases

NoSQL databases

Big data

Iâ€™ve documented my progress, tasks, and assignments on my GitHub(https://github.com/Rola-hub-tech/Database-with-XpandCS/tree/main), where you can find:
